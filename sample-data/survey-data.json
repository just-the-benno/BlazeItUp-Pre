    "What type of show would you enjoy and considering helpful in mastering Blazor?": "A mix of all of the above. If there was a dedicated space to promote and encourage the Blazor developer community, I believe it will help many people understand we're all in this together and they're not alone in their struggles to meet a deadline for a project. As someone whom has taken it upon himself to learn C#, .NET Core 3.1, JavaScript, Razor Pages, Blazor Server-Side, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Python, and several other things within the span of a couple months for an ambitious project to deliver within a couple months, I can easily say the biggest hurdle is locating an organized learning path to success. I'm more determined than most (I've built my entire career on self-study) so I know I will be able to deliver given enough time. However, I feel there is a lack of organization within the community at large right now, and having to jump in and out of various resources to get the information I need is frankly killing my development time. I've had to scrap and restart the same project a handful of times now due to misleading or poorly executed documentation regarding implemention of \"plug-n-play\" componets. Blazor is a new and largely different approach to traditional web app developement, so it's noone's fault in particular for having unorganized information out on the web (we can't all be GetBootstrap.com levels of documentation), but having a clearly defined approach to getting a demo ready web app up in running within a time-frame of say...two hours with only out-of-box features provided by Microsoft should be first priority, in my opinion. There is more than enough information out on the web to accomplish this, it just needs to be reorganized and translated from \"dev-speech\" to laymans terms for those of us whom are starting from the ground up.",
    "What content would you like to see?": "All of the above should be included, but the biggest thing to include in my opinon is the process of overcoming a particular task or feature a dev is trying to implement for the first time and how they were eventually able to achieve the desired (or at least acceptable) effect within their app. As someone whom's just starting out with front-end development, it can be disheartening or demoralizing to only see success stories without the context of how this person finally overcame their obstacle. Over time, a learner will begin to suspect they just aren't cut out to be a developer and this will kill their motivation to reach new heights within their career path. Most people won't admit it, but they need to feel like their struggles are justified, and need visual proof that can be traced from start to finish to further encourage the learning process.",
    "What are topics you would like to deepen your knowledge about?": "All of the above really, but the biggest thing for me personally is best practices and latest updates on GUI desgin for Blazor.",
    "How long should a show be? (applies to podcast, live coding, and tutorial videos)": "As long as you think it needs to be to throughly cover the given topic. People can pause, fast-foward, etc. a video. If you're concerned with keeping a viewer's attention span though, having timestamps for each main point or sub topic should help."
