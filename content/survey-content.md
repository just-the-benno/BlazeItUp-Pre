Thank you for your participating in the survey. It helped a lot to figure out what direction this project should take. I genuinely appreciate your time.

You can see the result of the survey. Each diagram has a "timeseries" mode, where you can see how the results change over time.

 The survey is still open and if you haven't voted yet, feel free to do it. The results are not shown immediately. I update them manually.
