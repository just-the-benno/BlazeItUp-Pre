Blaze it Up (working title) is a project to create a site with multiple content types to help .NET folks develop Blazor application. Beginners will find easy-to-follow tutorials, and while they learn the basics, they get access to advanced topics around Blazor. Besides, we provide insights into what's going on in the Blazor community by talking about libraries, recent developments, interviewing developers and partners.

Blaze It up will be free for everyone. It's from the community for the community.  That said, we are open to everyone who wants to contribute.  Unlike comparable services, we don't only allow you to publish your content, but we provide you with the feedback and network to create an excellent experience. Besides, It's about fun. If you enjoyed making your content, your readers/viewers would enjoy it too.

The project is in a very early stage. While the vision becomes more apparent, we are working on a strategy and towards the first public release at the end of March 2021. Here, you can find a quick overview and updates.
