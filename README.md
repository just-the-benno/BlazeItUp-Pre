# Blaze It Up Pre version

Blaze it Up (working title) is a project to create a site with multiple content types to help .NET folks develop Blazor application. Beginners will find easy-to-follow tutorials, and while they learn the basics, they get access to advanced topics around Blazor. Besides, we provide insights into what's going on in the Blazor community by talking about libraries, recent developments, interviewing developers and partners.

Blaze It up will be free for everyone. It's from the community for the community. That said, we are open to everyone who wants to contribute. Unlike comparable services, we don't only allow you to publish your content, but we provide you with the feedback and network to create an excellent experience. Besides, It's about fun. If you enjoyed making your content, your readers/viewers would enjoy it too.

The project is in a very early stage. While the vision becomes more apparent, we are working on a strategy and towards the first public release at the end of March 2021. Here, you can find a quick overview and updates.

This repo is used to build the pre page, available [https://just-the-benno.github.io/BlazeItUp-Pre/](https://just-the-benno.github.io/BlazeItUp-Pre/) 

## Survey

My intention for Blaze It Up is to be community-driven, right from the beginning. To better understand what type of content and topic folks are interested in, I started a [quick survey](https://forms.gle/vSePpS2QHoJbgsJ2A).

> I strip off information like names, email addresses, and comments from the survey to not display sensitive data. Regarding the name, there will be a dedicated survey for it. 

The survey is still open, and your answer will influence and what we focus on.  The results are updated once a day and can be viewed as [part of the pre page](https://just-the-benno.github.io/BlazeItUp-Pre/Survey)

## Contribute

There are plenty of [ways to contribute](https://just-the-benno.github.io/BlazeItUp-Pre/Contribute), like creator or reviewer. I appreciate anyone who can spare time and help me make this a great source of content around Blazor. Any contribution, as small or as huge, matters.   


## Newsletter

Once there is a significant announcement, we'll send a newsletter to everyone that has given us their address either per survey or by submitting the form on the page. Such events can be recent surveys regarding name, branding, etc., or when the strategy is ready to launch. I promise that the newsletters are always relevant and informative. 

> We'll add a possibility to unsubscribe soon
